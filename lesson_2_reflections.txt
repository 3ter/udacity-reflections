What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    The hidden folder .git is included in the directory. This is needed to track the files
    in the directory and the following commits. The nice shell zsh immediately knows to
    apply git-mechanics on a folder if it has been initialized.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is the intermediary in the situation. There we can bundle up files for
    one single commit. I think it helps to choose wisely what to add when. I am not sure
    why it is superior to just allowing "git commit" accepting multiple arguments.
