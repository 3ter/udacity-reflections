When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    When I want to use different computers and especially when I want to
    collaborate with others!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to decide myself when to publish something. I still can track
    any bugs and try things out on my local machine and as long as I
    don't need help from collaborators I don't have to be in sync.
